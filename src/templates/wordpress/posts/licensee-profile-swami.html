<h3><strong>About the Farm</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Swami Chaitanya and Nikki Lastreto are founders of Swami Select, a cannabis brand grown at their farm Ganja Ma Gardens, in the heart of California’s Emerald Triangle. Swami Select cannabis is sun-grown, cultivated in living soil using regenerative, organic methods for healthy, healing, inspirational use. </p>

<p>After continuously encountering cannabis and its various uses while traveling the world, Swami and Nikki settled into Mendocino County and began growing cannabis on their land in 2004. They learned and modified their methods along the way to create the cannabis and brand that Swami Select is today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What started as a joke picture of Swami and slogan, the Swami Select brand and Swami himself have become well-known figures in the cannabis community. “I took this picture of Swami and thought, well, that’s cool. Let’s put it inside one of these leaf medallions and make it look like a logo, and we’ll call it Swami Select,” Nikki said. “We started having community meetings up here in Mendocino County around 2014, talking about how to get <strong>our</strong> legal cannabis businesses started, and the most important thing clearly was to brand. So, we realized we already had it wrapped.”</p>

<h3><strong>Commitment to the Legal Market</strong></h3>

<p>“I never knew much about politics, but cannabis has taught me so much,” Swami said. “We’ve learned public speaking and how to tell our story and ask for what we need in front of the board of supervisors.” Living through the height of the cannabis legalization movement, Swami and Nikki have become advocates for legal cultivation. Starting in 2016, they attended many board of supervisor’s meetings in Mendocino County to shape legislation around growing cannabis. More recently, they are working with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) on the Appellations program to ensure the guidelines support small independent farmers.</p>

<h3><strong>Proud to Be a Licensed Grower</strong></h3>

<p>Nikki and Swami are involved in today’s legal cannabis movement as much as they were initially. When they started growing cannabis, they knew it would not be just about making money, but it would be a lot about education. Teaching others about the benefits and the history of cannabis helps break down the stigma around the plant and show<strong>s</strong> that it really is medicine. “The use of cannabis is an ancient tradition, and we feel that it is our duty to revive its history because it’s a noble history,” Swami said. As cannabis becomes legalized across the nation and even the world, Nikki and Swami hope to teach others its past and, in doing so, preserve the history of cannabis and its uses as we go forward.  </p>
