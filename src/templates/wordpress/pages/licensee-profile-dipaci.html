<h3>About the Farm</h3>

<p>Christina DiPaci and her childhood friends/business partners, Emiliano Acevedo and Zachary Burnham, own and operate Caliber Farms in Salinas in Monterey County. Their farm consists of three greenhouses, with 210,000 square-feet of cannabis that is harvested every two weeks. They have renovated and retrofitted the greenhouses to consistently produce quality cannabis flower at scale. In addition to cultivation, the trio is embarking on collaborations with leading players in the cannabis industry to create innovative products and experiences.</p>

<p>DiPaci and her partners used to operate a medicinal farm in Humboldt County, and in 2016 they moved to Monterey County. They entered the legal cultivation market immediately after Californians passed Proposition 64 in 2016, and now they hold commercial cannabis cultivation, nursery, and processing licenses.</p>

<h3>Commitment to the Legal Market</h3>

<p>“We’ve put all our money into this company and we’re going to protect it as much as we can—and that means being compliant,” DiPaci says. “Working with the various state and local regulatory agencies has been symbiotic and fruitful.”</p>

<p>DiPaci gives advice to aspiring cannabis growers whenever she can. Her first piece of advice is to reach out to other licensed growers and ask as many questions as possible. “Immediately after Prop 64, it was survival of the fittest. But through the struggle, we built a great community,” DiPaci says, noting that Caliber Farms’ success is due to an expansive and helpful network of breeders, cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, and salespeople. “Tap into that network. Nobody in this industry should feel alone.”</p>

<h3>Proud to Be a Licensed Grower</h3>

<p>DiPaci, Acevedo, and Burnham are proud of California’s cannabis cultivation industry, but they say it’s not always easy. “The hours you have to work are crazy. You have to be good at learning from your mistakes and bouncing back from them,” DiPaci says. “You have to learn so much every day. It’s crazy, but crazy loves company.”</p>

<p>Legal cultivation has made it easier for farmers to share information and their knowledge of growing commercial cannabis, DiPaci explains. “Nobody would share their techniques honestly before,” she says, “but now everyone is working together, in a way. We are all figuring out best practices together.”</p>

<p>As growers, DiPaci says she and her partners care about more than just the plants. “We are rooted in love for our community and our planet. Sustainably growing cannabis—and making it accessible and affordable for everyone—is why we’re here!”</p>
