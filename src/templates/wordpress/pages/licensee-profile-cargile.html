<h2><strong>Kimberly Cargile</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A Therapeutic Alternative </strong><br><strong>Sacramento </strong></p>

<h3><strong>About A Therapeutic Alternative&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Founded in 2009, A Therapeutic Alternative (ATA) seeks to provide high-quality products and services to their customers. Cargile shared that ATA was founded with four core values, which continue to drive her and her team – health, happiness, education, and industry leadership. In addition to working with customers to find the best cannabis solution for their health or recreational interests, the ATA team hosts a variety of classes to help educate the Sacramento community. Classes cover a wide range of topics including the history of cannabis, cannabis laws and legal compliance, product attributes, and human anatomy and physiology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ATA’s product offering is very important to Cargile because she believes this is an area where ATA can work to preserve the cannabis industry and support small, diverse businesses that give back, are active industry advocates, and care about prioritizing environmental sustainability. Every potential company is asked a series of questions before ATA chooses to partner with them. Cargile says this helps ATA identify companies with diverse ownership, who are legacy operators, run small farms or purchase from small farms, or are focused on giving back to the cannabis community, environment, and the community at large.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Benefits of Being in the Legal Marketplace</strong></h3>

<p>When ATA was founded, Cargile was working as a medical cannabis patient’s rights advocate. She reflected on the day regulations were passed, saying, “It was a wonderful day. I had been in the industry for almost 20 years before getting my license and I knew we were progressing. There was no doubt in my mind that ATA would be pursuing a state license and to help push our industry forward.”</p>

<p>Receiving a license was important to Cargile because it meant she could operate her business while building a relationship with her community and strengthening her relationship with government as a cannabis advocate. “Having a good relationship with the government and knowing there is a path forward to being a legitimate business was something I always wanted. I never wanted to be ashamed of what I do. As I licensed business, I can openly have a conversation with anyone. The feeling of getting my license was extraordinary after years of struggle and trying to bring legitimacy to the industry.”</p>

<p>In addition to ATA, Cargile now has 10 additional licensed cannabis businesses in operation and three more focused on the licensing and permitting process. The legal marketplace has allowed Cargile to successfully grow multiple businesses with which she aims to advance the industry and use her licenses and legal status as a “tool for legitimate conversation to drive change.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Pride in Being a Licensed Retailer&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>It is important to Cargile that she share what she has learned with other young entrepreneurs who want to enter the cannabis industry, which is why she founded an ownership incubator program five years ago. “Since its founding the program 25 of my employees have participated in the ownership incubator program and are now co-owners of their own cannabis companies. The program is really special to me because I have not heard of many other companies helping their employees move up and progress in the industry in this way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cargile is also sharing her knowledge and experience advocating for federal legalization and regulations with her position on the board of the National Cannabis Industry Association and the Nor Cal Cannabis to advocate for federal legalization and reasonable regulations. It is important to Cargile that she expand her work beyond California and push for other cannabis business owners to experience legalization and as Cargile puts it, “It is important that these people be able to tell their families, their children, and their community what they do. Further legalization will push our industry forward.”</p>
