# Design System CSS

This component contains the baseline CSS for the design system.

It should contain universal styles like resets, typography, colors, spacing, utility classes

It should expose values as CSS variables to be redefined in specific projects.

## Todo

Right now it contains an export of a design system starter kit to show an example structure. All this code should be replaced with our own styles.
