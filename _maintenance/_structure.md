## Files which will remain in this repo
* `/src/templates/wordpress` content is written here by our publishing service from the WordPress API. 
    * These files are not be manually modified in this repo.
    * We are thinking about the idea of using a separate content git repo, because content injects make branch based development more tricky. 
    * In the meantime, there is a bash script that attempts to facilitate the merges.
