# Acknowledgements

Sharing appreciations, acknowledgements and gratitude for influences, support that helped us create these templates.

*Trying an idea: Include three at a time & sign with your github name. Loosely influenced by social media video meme, "You've got three looks & that's it!" in which people can make three short reaction videos.*

* Thank you everyone from many, many open source communities and community survey projects for persisting in promoting the community building factors for writing technology project documentation, as a way of building community, belonging and inclusion. - @chachasikes
* Thank you Amelia Winger-Bearskin for all that you have publicly shared on documentation, decentralized story-telling and antecedent technologies. And for your recent work on land acknowledgment. I saw your Instagram posts after telling a story about the origin of Government README files, and I would like to learn to acknowledge the California land as someone who has made California my home. - @chachasikes
* Thank you Daniel Beck for your talk on Write the Readable README. It was very helpful to have your breakdown of many README files, and it helped our team come up with a simple framework to try to write what are hopefully more comprehensible. - @chachasikes
