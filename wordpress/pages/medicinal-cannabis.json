Medical marijuana ID cards are voluntary. If you have one, your cannabis purchases are exempt from sales and use tax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical marijuana ID cards are valid for up to one year. Both patients and their primary caregiver can get a card.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get a medical marijuana ID card</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"steps\"><li><strong>Fill out the application</strong><br><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">Download and complete the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/MMICP-Forms-and-Appeals.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">medical marijuana ID card application</a> form.</span></li><li><strong>Gather your supporting documents</strong><br><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">When you apply, you’ll need a copy of your medical recommendation, proof of identity (driver’s license or other government-issued ID), proof of residency that shows your name and current address (like a rent or mortgage agreement, utility bill, or California motor vehicle registration)</span></li><li><strong>Make an appointment with your county health department</strong><br><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">You must submit your application in person. Contact the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/County-Program-and-Hours.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">health department</a> for the county you live in for an appointment.</span></li><li><strong>Go to your appointment</strong><br><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">You’ll pay an application fee and have your photo taken for your ID card. Application fees vary by county, but they are not more than $100. If you’re applying as a primary caregiver, the patient will need to come to your appointment with you. If you receive healthcare through Medi-Cal, your application fee is reduced by 50%. If you receive healthcare through a medically-indigent service program, your application fee is waived.</span></li><li><strong>Wait for approval</strong><br><span class=\"has-inline-color has-black-color\">It can take up to 35 days for the county health department to issue your medical marijuana ID card.</span></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>What to do if your application is denied</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/Pages/MMICP-Forms-and-Appeals.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">file an appeal</a> with the California Department of Public Health if your county health department denies your application. There is no fee to appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is a primary caregiver</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Primary caregivers are responsible for a patient’s everyday needs, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Housing</li><li>Health</li><li>Safety</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Primary caregivers must be at least 18 years old and may include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A parent</li><li>The owner, operator or employee of a licensed facility, such as:<ul><li>A clinic</li><li>Hospice</li><li>Home health agency</li></ul></li></ul>\n",
