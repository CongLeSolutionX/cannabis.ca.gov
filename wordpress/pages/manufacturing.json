      "rendered": "\n<p>Manufacturers extract cannabinoids and terpenes from cannabis plants and make products out of the extract. The types of products they make vary widely and include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Food and beverages</li><li>Vape cartridges</li><li>Lotions and balms</li><li>Lozenges and sublingual sprays</li><li>Pills and tablets</li><li>Dab, shatter and wax</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis manufacturers use techniques and processes common in other types of consumer product manufacturing. Manufacturing steps differ based on the type of manufacturing, but generally include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Extraction of cannabinoids</li><li>Post-processing (refinement) of cannabis extract</li><li>Infusion of extract or plant material with other ingredients</li><li>Packaging and labeling cannabis products</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Manufacturing licenses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a <a href=\"https://staginginye.prod3.sites.ca.gov/applicants/license-types/#manufacturing-license-types\" data-type=\"page\">manufacturing license</a> to make cannabis products in California. The type of manufacturing license you need depends on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What activities you do</li><li>Whether you do extraction and post processing</li><li>What types of chemicals you use (if any)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You need a different license if you manufacture in a shared-use facility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Good manufacturing practices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Cannabis Control’s regulations require manufacturers to follow good manufacturing practices (GMPs) when making products. GMPs help ensure products are: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Free of contaminants and safe for consumers</li><li>Produced consistently every time</li><li>Labeled correctly</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufacturers must demonstrate GMPs by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maintaining a sanitary facility, equipment and utensils</li><li>Using written procedures and instructions</li><li>Documenting work</li><li>Protecting against contamination</li><li>Including controls in processes</li><li>Practicing personal hygiene</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Documenting manufacturing processes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufacturers must keep up-to-date documents with their procedures and instructions for making products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Product quality plan</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A product quality plan includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An assessment of the potential hazards in your facility and manufacturing practices</li><li>The preventative measures you use to mitigate risks</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You must have a product quality plan for each type of product manufactured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Master manufacturing protocols</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Master manufacturing protocols are step-by-step instructions for creating your product. They are the “recipe” that staff follow to ensure they make the products the same way each time. You must have a master manufacturing protocol for each formulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH Document Library/Checklist_MasterManufacturingProtocol.pdf\">master manufacturing protocol checklist</a> to make sure your protocols include the required information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Batch production records</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Batch production records document all the steps you take to create your product. Most manufacturers create a template that their staff can fill out when they complete each step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH Document Library/Checklist_BatchProductionRecords.pdf\">batch production records checklist</a> to make sure your templates include the required information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Packaging and labeling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufactured cannabis products must be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Packaged to prevent product contamination</li><li>Labeled so consumers know what they’re buying or using</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Packaging</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Packaging must be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Child resistant</li><li>Tamper evident</li><li>Resealable (if it contains multiple servings)</li><li>Opaque (if it is an edible)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH Document Library/PackagingChecklist.pdf\">packaging checklist</a> to make sure your product is properly packaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Labeling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis product labels have two parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Primary panel – the part of the label displayed to the consumer at retail; typically found on the front or the top of the package</li><li>Informational panel – any other part of the label that is not the primary panel</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You must list certain information on each part of the label. Use the <a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH Document Library/LabelingChecklist-Products.pdf\">labeling checklist</a> to make sure your product has the required information.</p>\n",
