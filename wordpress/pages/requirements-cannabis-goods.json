Examples include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Packaged flower </li><li>Pre-rolls that only contain plant material</li><li>Packaged seeds </li><li>Immature plants sold at retail </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Manufactured cannabis products</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manufactured cannabis products are finished goods that contain extracted cannabis or non-cannabis ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Edible cannabis products</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Edible cannabis products are consumed by mouth and resemble traditional food and beverages. Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Baked goods </li><li>Candies and sweets</li><li>Mints  </li><li>Drink additives  </li><li>Drinks  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cannabis concentrates</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis concentrates are made mostly of extracted cannabis. Examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Vape cartridges</li><li>Dab, shatter, wax </li><li>Tinctures</li><li>Tablets and pills </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Topical cannabis products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Topical cannabis products are used on the skin. Examples include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lotions and creams  </li><li>Balms</li><li>Patches </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Packaging and labeling</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Packaging requirements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannabis goods are required to be in packaging that is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Child-resistant </li><li>Tamper-evident</li><li>Resealable (if more than one serving) </li><li>Opaque (if an edible cannabis product) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DCC has guides to help you understand the requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/PackagingChecklist.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Packaging requirements</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Handout_CRPPackaging_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Child-resistant packaging</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Labeling requirements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Labels have two parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Primary panel – the portion of the label most likely to be displayed to the consumer at retail </li><li>Informational panel – any other part of the label</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DCC has labeling checklists to help you make sure all required information is on your label:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LabelingChecklist-Flower.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For nonmanufactured cannabis products</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/LabelingChecklist-Products.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">For manufactured cannabis products</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Download the universal symbol</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The universal symbol for cannabis alerts people that the product contains cannabis. It must be on the primary panel of all cannabis goods sold in California. Do not alter the symbol, other than changing the size. It must be at least ½ inch by ½ inch in size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download the universal symbol to use on your package:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/PublishingImages/UniversalSymbol.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">JPG</a> </li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/PublishingImages/UniversalSymbol.png\" target=\"_blank\">PNG</a></li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/MCSB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/UniversalSymbol_ADA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>What cannot be on a label</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers use the information on labels to decide what products they buy and use. That’s why it’s important that labels do not include anything that is false or misleading. Do not:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use the name of a California county, unless 100% of the cannabis was grown there</li><li>Use designs attractive to children, including:  <ul><li>Cartoons </li><li>Images popularly used to advertise to children </li><li>Imitations of candy labeling </li><li>The words “candy,” “candies” or anything similar  </li></ul></li><li>Make unproven health claims </li><li>Use the words “organic” or “OCal” unless you are registered with the California Department of Food and Agriculture or California Department of Public Health </li><li>Market the cannabis good as an alcoholic beverage </li><li>Include a picture of the product (edibles) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Report non-compliant product</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell us if you see cannabis goods being sold that do not meet the packaging or labeling standards. Report non-compliant product through our <a href=\"https://staginginye.prod3.sites.ca.gov/resources-2/file-complaint/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"712\">online complaint form</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other requirements for cannabis goods</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A complete list of requirements for cannabis and cannabis products is in the <a href=\"https://staginginye.prod3.sites.ca.gov/resources/rulemaking/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"710\">DCC regulations</a>.</p>\n",
