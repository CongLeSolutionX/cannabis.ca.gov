<p>Regulations are made through a process called rulemaking. It gives the public the opportunity to take part in the creation of regulations proposed by California state agencies.</p>

<h2>How regulations are made</h2>

<p>The Office of Administrative Law (OAL) oversees rulemaking process. OAL makes sure that state agencies follow California’s laws when they adopt new regulations.</p>

<p>There are two types of rulemaking procedures: regular and emergency.</p>

<p>Most regulations are adopted using the regular rulemaking process. Some are adopted using the emergency rulemaking process, which allows rules to go into effect faster. The Department of Cannabis Control (DCC) can use the emergency rulemaking process when making rules for cannabis businesses.</p>

<h3>Regular rulemaking process</h3>

<ol><li>An agency publishes a summary of the proposed regulations in the California Regulatory Notice Register (also called Notice Register). The summary explains what the regulation does, why it is being created and its possible impact.</li><li>The public has 45 days to comment on the proposed regulations.</li><li>The agency publishes a summary of the public comments and the responses in the Notice Register.</li><li>If the agency changes the regulation based on the comments, the public has another 15 days to comment.</li><li>Once the agency is satisfied with the regulations, it publishes an updated summary to the Notice Register.</li><li>The agency has up to one year from the first notice to complete the regulations.</li></ol>

<h3>Emergency rulemaking process</h3>

<p>Emergency regulations are rules that can be put in place immediately while the agency completes the full rulemaking process. The emergency rulemaking process has different requirements, but generally includes:</p>

<ul><li>A brief public notice period</li><li>A five-day public comment period</li></ul>

<h2>Pending rulemaking actions</h2>

<h3>Section 100 – Submitted to OAL on July 1, 2021</h3>

<p>This rulemaking action moves the existing cannabis regulations out of Titles 3, 16, and 17 in the California Code of Regulations and into Title 4. This change would place all DCC regulations in Title 4, Division 19.</p>
