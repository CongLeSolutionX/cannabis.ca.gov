The search warrant was served at 11623 Sheldon St., Ste. C, and resulted in the seizure of over $1.6 million in cannabis products. 288 cannabis plants were also seized from an illegal indoor grow in the back of the retailer.</p>\n<p>The Los Angeles Police Department and the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration assisted DOI-CEU in the serving of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law.
