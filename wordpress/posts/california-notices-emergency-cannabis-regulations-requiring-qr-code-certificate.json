The proposed regulations, which have been posted to the <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/cannabis_regs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau’s website</a>, would require licensed retailers to print and post their unique QR Code in storefront windows or near entrances, to help educate consumers about the importance of supporting and purchasing products from the legal cannabis market.</p>\n<p>Smartphone users are able to use their smartphone camera to scan the displayed QR Code, which automatically links to the <a href=\"https://online.bcc.ca.gov/bcc/customization/bcc/cap/licenseSearch.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau’s Online License Search</a> and confirms the cannabis retailer’s license status. The system also displays the retailer’s address and license location to ensure that the information is not counterfeit.</p>\n<p>“The proposed regulations will help consumers avoid purchasing cannabis goods from unlicensed businesses by providing a simple way to confirm licensure immediately before entering the premises or receiving a delivery,” said Bureau Chief Lori Ajax. “These requirements will also assist law enforcement in distinguishing between legal and illegal transportation of cannabis goods.”</p>\n<p>This announcement comes after the Bureau’s recent launch of a QR Code campaign, which encourages licensees to voluntarily post a Bureau provided unique QR Code certificate that consumers can scan when they visit a licensed cannabis retailer.</p>\n<p>Following the required minimum five-working day notice to the public, the Bureau will file the emergency regulations with the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). The five-calendar day formal public comment period begins when OAL publishes the proposed regulations as being “under review” on its website: <a href=\"https://oal.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://oal.ca.gov/</a>. Public comments must be submitted to both OAL and the Bureau to be considered.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California must be conducted on a premises with a valid license issued by the appropriate state cannabis licensing authority. Manufacturing, distributing or selling cannabis goods without a state license or at a location that is not licensed is a violation of state law.
