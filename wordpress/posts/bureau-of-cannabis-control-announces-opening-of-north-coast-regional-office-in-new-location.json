Members of the public may pay their fees, submit license applications, and have questions answered in person at this location.</p>\n<p><em>To subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.
