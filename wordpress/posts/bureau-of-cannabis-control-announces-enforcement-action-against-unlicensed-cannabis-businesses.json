The search warrants covered two locations: 204 F St., Ste. A1 in Davis, and 1779 Tribute Rd, Ste. 6 in Sacramento. The operation resulted in the seizure of $854,812 in cannabis products.</p>\n<p>DOI-CEU also assisted the Los Angeles County Sherriff’s Department in serving a separate search warrant on Tuesday, February 27, 2019, on “Space Lounge,” an unlicensed cannabis retailer located at 1710 N. Eastern Ave. in Los Angeles. This operation resulted in the seizure of $439,776 in cannabis products.</p>\n<p>The combined value of cannabis seized from these unlicensed operators totaled $1,294,588.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities.
