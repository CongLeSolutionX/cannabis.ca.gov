These letters warn landlords that they may personally be subject to criminal and civil penalties for allowing illegal cannabis activity to occur on their property.</p>\n<p>“This action is an important step in the state’s effort to combat the illegal cannabis market,” Bureau Chief Lori Ajax said. “It is our hope that by detailing the penalties faced by landlords who rent their space to illegal operators, landlords will better understand the severe consequences that could come with knowingly facilitating illegal commercial cannabis activity and those currently breaking the law will have fewer options where they can conduct their businesses.”</p>\n<p>Examples of the types of penalties outlined in the letter include California <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&amp;sectionNum=11366.5\">Health and Safety Code section 11366.5, subdivision (a)</a>, which makes it a criminal offense to allow property to be used for any illegal cannabis activity. Additionally, illegal operators are subject to forfeiture and other criminal penalties. A person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime, including unlicensed cannabis activity, may be held liable for the crime as if the person directly committed the offense.</p>\n<p>In addition to criminal liability, landlords may be subject to fines and civil liability. <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&amp;division=10.&amp;title=&amp;part=&amp;chapter=3.&amp;article=\">Business and Professions Code section 26031.5</a> allows for the imposition of fines up to $30,000 per day for illegal cannabis activity.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California must be conducted on a premises with a valid state license. Manufacturing, distributing or selling cannabis goods without a state license or at a location that is not licensed is a violation of state law.
