      "rendered": "<p><strong>Sacramento</strong> – The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) reported revenue numbers today for cannabis sales for the 4th quarter of 2018. Tax revenue reported by the cannabis industry totaled $103.3 million for 4th quarter returns due by January 31, 2019, which includes state cultivation, excise, and sales taxes. It does not include tax revenue collected by each jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>As of February 14, 2019, California&#8217;s cannabis excise tax generated $50.8 million in revenue reported on 4th quarter returns due by January 31, 2019. The cultivation tax generated $16.4 million and the sales tax generated $36.1 million in reported revenue. Retail sales of medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products are exempt from sales and use taxes if the purchaser provides a valid Medical Marijuana Identification card and valid government-issued identification card.</p>\n<p>Previously reported revenue for 3rd quarter returns was revised to $100.8 million, which included $53.3 million in excise tax, $12.6 million in cultivation tax, and $34.9 million in sales tax.</p>\n<p>Revisions to quarterly data are the result of amended and late returns, and other tax return adjustments.</p>\n<p>In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, the Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act. Beginning on January 1, 2018, two new cannabis taxes went into effect: a cultivation tax on all harvested cannabis that enters the commercial market and a 15 percent excise tax upon purchasers of cannabis and cannabis products. In addition, retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products are subject to state and local sales tax.</p>\n<p>To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm\">Tax Guide for Cannabis Businesses</a> on the CDTFA website.</p>\n<p>Note: This news release may discuss complex tax laws and concepts.
