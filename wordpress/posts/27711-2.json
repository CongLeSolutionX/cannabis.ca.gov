This system will record the movement of cannabis and cannabis products through the supply chain, from cultivation to sale. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> CDFA anticipates issuing cannabis cultivation licenses on or about January 1, 2018. In addition to state licensure, applicants are required to comply with any local cannabis cultivation requirements. Applications should check with their local jurisdiction regarding local ordinance requirements.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
