Each licensing authority was tasked with establishing new government programs that would shift the nation’s first medical cannabis market created by Proposition 215 to arguably the world’s largest fully-regulated commercial cannabis industry.</p>\n<p>In an effort to continuously improve these cannabis programs, and with support from Governor Gavin Newsom, the Office of Innovation under the California Health and Human Services Agency is assessing the online licensing and complaints portals used by the three state licensing authorities. To fully assess these online portals, the Office of Innovation is requesting your feedback.</p>\n<p>Please take a few moments to fill out this brief survey, which will remain open until January 12, 2020: [link removed].</p>\n",
