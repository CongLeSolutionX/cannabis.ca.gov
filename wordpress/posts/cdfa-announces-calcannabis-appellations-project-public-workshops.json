      "rendered": "<p>The California Department of Food and Agriculture’s (CDFA) CalCannabis Cultivation Licensing Division will hold six public workshops throughout California in September to solicit input on establishing a framework for the CalCannabis Appellations Project. CDFA is required to develop a process allowing licensed cultivators to establish appellations of standards, practices, and varietals applicable to cannabis grown in a certain geographical area in California. The purpose of this first round of workshops is to get input from cultivators and other stakeholders on how the cannabis appellations process should be developed.</p>\n<p>Workshop participants can share suggestions in person or in writing. The focus of these workshops is only on appellations—not any other aspect of the cannabis cultivation licensing process.</p>\n<p>All workshops are scheduled from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., except the Sacramento location, which is from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The workshops are free and pre-registration is not required.
