Prior to that law’s passage, state licensing authorities had released proposed regulations to govern the implementation of the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. The public hearings and comments from a broad cross section of stakeholders that were informing that regulatory process have also been taken into consideration in the drafting of these proposed emergency regulations.</p>\n<p>The licensing authorities expect the emergency regulations to be effective in December 2017. The implementation date for the issuance of the state commercial cannabis licenses remains the same: January 1, 2018. However, California will only be able to license those businesses that are in compliance will all local laws.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency will hold a workshop with state-chartered banks and credit unions next month to discuss regulatory and compliance issues, as well as potential approaches to banking cannabis-related businesses.</p>\n<p>For additional information about the proposed regulations, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit our website &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.</p>\n<p>For information on all three licensing authorities, please visit the state’s cannabis web portal – <a href=\"\">cannabis.ca.gov</a>.
