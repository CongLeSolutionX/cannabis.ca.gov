<p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic',sans-serif; color: #050505;">On September 17, the Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) announced a Request for Proposals for university research grants for public universities in California. The Bureau has $30 million to be disbursed for research projects related to the implementation and effect of Proposition 64.</span></p>
<p style="background: white;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Century Gothic',sans-serif; color: #050505;">The application window officially closed on October 19, and the Bureau received more than 100 proposals. Due to the high volume of response, the Bureau has decided to postpone notification for grant recipients. An official announcement will come by the end of next week. This will allow more time for careful consideration and review of each proposal.</span></p>
