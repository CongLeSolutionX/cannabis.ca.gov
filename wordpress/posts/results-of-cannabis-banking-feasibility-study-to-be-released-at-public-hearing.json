This stalemate created numerous banking issues for these businesses, as well as forced cannabis businesses to deal in large amounts of cash — making them targets for violent crimes and putting the general public in danger. Security and procedural concerns about dealing with a cash-only industry also created a nightmare for state and local government revenue-collecting agencies.</p>\n<p>Based on one of the recommendations from a 2017 CBWG report, the State Treasurer’s Office commissioned Level 4 this past August to settle the lingering critical questions about whether a public cannabis bank would be possible.</p>\n<p>The report will be available on the <a href=\"https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">California State Treasurer’s website</a> the day of the hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>EVENT:</strong> Cannabis Banking Working Group to be presented with cannabis banking feasibility study at public hearing.</p>\n<p><strong>WHO:</strong> California State Treasurer John Chiang, Members of the Cannabis Banking Work Group, Members of the public.</p>\n<p><strong>WHEN:</strong> Thursday, December 27, 2018 at 1 PM</p>\n<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> California State Capitol, Senate Room 112, 1315 10th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814</p>\n<p>Live The public hearing is scheduled to be carried via Facebook Live on Streaming: Treasurer Chiang’s STO Facebook page: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CaliforniaSTO/\">https://www.facebook.com/CaliforniaSTO/</a></p>\n<p>For more news about the State Treasurer’s office, please follow Treasurer Chiang on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalTreasurer\">@CalTreasurer</a>, and on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/California-State-Treasurers-Office/356962197807214\">California State Treasurer&#8217;s Office</a>.</p>\n",
