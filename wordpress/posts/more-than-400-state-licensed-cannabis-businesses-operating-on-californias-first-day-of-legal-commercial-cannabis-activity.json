More than 400 Cannabis operators, from Shasta Lake to the City of San Diego, now hold state licenses in the largest cannabis market in the country.</p>\n<p>“This is an historic day for the state of California,” Bureau of Cannabis Control Chief Lori Ajax said. “It marks the beginning of a legal cannabis marketplace that will be well regulated in order to protect consumers and maintain a level playing field for cannabis-related businesses. We are hopeful that we have put forth a model that other states will look to as an example when they head down the path to legalization.”</p>\n<p>The Bureau began issuing temporary licenses ahead of its January 1 mandate. In addition to the more than 400 licenses issued by the Bureau, over 4,400 users have registered with the Bureau’s online system and more than 1,800 applications have been submitted.</p>\n<p>State licenses for cannabis manufacturers and cultivators have also been issued by the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture, respectively.</p>\n<p>Those interested in applying for a license or running a license search can access the Bureau’s online licensing system at <a href=\"http://online.bcc.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://online.bcc.ca.gov/</a>. A temporary license issued by the Bureau is good for 120 days, after which a permanent license must be obtained.</p>\n<p>For additional information on licensing, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit our website: <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.</p>\n<p>For information on all three licensing authorities, please visit the state’s California Cannabis Portal: <a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cannabis.ca.gov</a>.
