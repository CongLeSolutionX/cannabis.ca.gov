The investigation was conducted based upon a complaint received by the Bureau. The search warrant resulted in the seizure of over $250,000 of cannabis and cannabis products.</p>\n<p>DOI-CEU also assisted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) with serving a separate search warrant on Tuesday, February 5, 2019, on “Smoking Aces,” an unlicensed cannabis retailer located at 1411 S. Robertson Blvd. in Los Angeles. The operation resulted in the seizure of $27,637 in cannabis products. Two firearms were seized at the scene and six suspects were arrested under LAPD’s warrant.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law.
