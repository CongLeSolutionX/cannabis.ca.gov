An applicant is no longer required to hold or have held a temporary license to obtain a&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license may now be issued if an applicant has submitted a completed annual license application to the Bureau, including evidence that compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) and compliance with local ordinances enacted pursuant to Section 26200 are either completed or underway.</p>\n<p>Please note that <strong>if you already have a pending annual license application with the Bureau, you do not need to submit a separate provisional license application.</strong> We will be&nbsp;reviewing the application to&nbsp;determine if the applicant may be issued a&nbsp;provisional&nbsp;license and will contact the applicant if additional information is required.</p>\n<p>Applicants who wish to obtain a provisional license but have not yet submitted an annual license application may now do so by registering an account on the Bureau’s online self-service portal. The link to the Bureau’s Online Licensing System can be found here: <a href=\"http://online.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://online.bcc.ca.gov/</a>. For more information on how to fully utilize the online system, including instructions for completing and submitting an application, users can check out the website’s e-Learning portal located here: <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/clear/e_learning.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/clear/e_learning.html</a>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, applicants may also apply for a license by filling out the paper <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/clear/forms.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">application forms</a> listed on our website and submitting them by email, mail, or in person at one of our two office locations:</p>\n<p><strong>Office Headquarters:</strong> 2920, Kilgore Road, Rancho Cordova, CA 96570<br />\n<strong>North Coast Regional Office:</strong> 930 Sixth Street, Eureka, CA 95501</p>\n<p>If you are contacted by the Bureau requesting additional information regarding your submitted application, please respond promptly so that processing of a provisional license is not delayed.</p>\n",
