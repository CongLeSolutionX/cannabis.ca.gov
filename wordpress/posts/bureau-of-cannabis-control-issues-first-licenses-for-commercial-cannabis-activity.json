A temporary license is good for 120 days, after which a permanent license must be obtained.</p>\n<p>Those interested in licensure can access the Bureau’s online licensing system at <a href=\"http://online.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://online.bcc.ca.gov/</a>. Users are required to register an account on the Bureau’s online self-service portal prior to applying for a license.</p>\n<p>To date, more than 1,900 users have registered with the Bureau’s online system, and more than 200 applications have been submitted.</p>\n<p>For additional information about the licensing application process, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, visit <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on commercial cannabis licenses for manufacturing, visit the California Department of Public Health website, <a href=\"http://www.cdph.ca.gov/mcsb\">www.cdph.ca.gov/mcsb</a>. Parties interested in applying for a commercial cannabis license for cultivation should go to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) website, <a href=\"http://calcannabis.cdfa.ca.gov/\">http://calcannabis.cdfa.ca.gov/</a>, where the licensing system will be available in late December.</p>\n<p>For additional information on all three licensing authorities, please visit the California Cannabis Porta at cannabis.ca.gov.
