Those interested in viewing this report may do so by clicking the following link: <a href=\"https://www.bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/cac_annual_report_2018.pdf\">https://www.bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/cac_annual_report_2018.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Currently comprised of 22 appointed members from different sectors to represent the diverse backgrounds of California and the cannabis industry, the CAC is charged with advising the licensing authorities in the development of standards and regulations, including best practices and guidelines that protect public health and safety while ensuring a regulated environment for commercial cannabis activity that does not impose such barriers so as to perpetuate, rather than reduce and eliminate, the illicit market for cannabis.</p>\n<p>The CAC began its work in November 2017, holding 10 meetings statewide in its inaugural year. The CAC is charged with publishing an annual report on its activities, including the recommendations the committee made to the licensing authorities and whether those recommendations were implemented.</p>\n<p>The Cannabis Advisory Committee benefited from the active participation from experts, local officials, business leaders, patient advocates, veteran groups, compassionate use collectives, industry-specific organizations, and members of the community. We would like to thank the individuals who attended the meetings, provided thoughtful public comment, and engaged with the work of the committee. We look forward to your continued participation to improve the industry.</p>\n",
