So the idea of them turning around and regulating non-medical cannabis is going to be a tough sell,&#8221; said Michael Green, Fresno Cannabis Association.</p>\n<p>Green of the Fresno Cannabis Association is encouraged by the stance taken by Coalinga which has approved commercial marijuana cultivation.</p>\n<p>The shirt worn by attorney Bill McPike was made from the silk of hemp stock. Industrial hemp contains a much lower THC level than cannabis.</p>\n<p>Conference organizers said it could eventually be a profitable crop for a farmer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Canada has over 30,000 acres of industrial hemp. They make hemp oil, which is like virgin olive oil but hemp has different flavor to it and it&#8217;s<br />\nlegal&#8211; 100-percent legal,&#8221; said McPike.</p>\n<p>The state has already formed an industrial hemp advisory board.</p>\n<p>Wednesday&#8217;s Cannabis and Hemp Conference drew over 60 people to Downtown Fresno.</p>\n",
