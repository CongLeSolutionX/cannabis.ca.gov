An appellation is a certified designation or title that may signify standards, practices, and the varietal of cannabis grown in a certain geographical area. The term is used most often with “appellation of origin,” which identifies the geographical origin of a product and sometimes how a product was produced.</p>\n<p>We would appreciate it if you would take a few minutes to complete the short survey below to help us estimate the number of licensed cultivators who might be interested in attending our public cannabis appellations workshops. Click <a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/77637/107898/1400/3/\">here</a> to complete our survey.</p>\n<p>Please respond to the survey by Friday, August 10, 2018.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, contact the CalCannabis Appellations Program by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:CDFA.CalCannabis_Appellations@cdfa.ca.gov\">CDFA.CalCannabis_Appellations@cdfa.ca.gov</a>.</p>\n",
