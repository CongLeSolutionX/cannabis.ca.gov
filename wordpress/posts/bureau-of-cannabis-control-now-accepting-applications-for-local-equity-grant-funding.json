Local jurisdiction applicants that submit timely applications and meet the eligibility requirements will receive a minimum grant of $100,000 unless a lesser grant amount is requested. Only local jurisdictions are eligible for grant funds.</p>\n<p><em>To subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at </em><a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\"><em>http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</em></a><em>.
