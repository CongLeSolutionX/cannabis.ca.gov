Temporary licenses may be extended for 90-day periods if the licensee submits a complete annual license application&nbsp;<span>before&nbsp;</span>the expiration date.</p>\n<p>No extensions will be granted to temporary licensees who do not submit an annual license application prior to the expiration date on their license. If a manufacturer’s temporary license expires, the business will be required to cease operations until an annual license has been issued, as operating a commercial cannabis business without an active state license is a violation of the law.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Scan Requirement:</strong><br />\nOne of the requirements for the annual license application is that Live Scan fingerprinting be completed for each person who qualifies as an “owner” of the business. The ‘Request for Live Scan’ form needed for this process is currently unavailable.</p>\n<p>Applicants can bypass the required Live Scan fields on the licensing system at this time in order to complete the remainder of the annual license application. Completion of the annual license application will begin the review process and qualify a temporary license holder for an extension, but a final determination on licensure cannot be made until the Live Scan form is available and submitted for each owner.</p>\n<p><strong>Accessing the Annual License Application:</strong><br />\nThe annual license application is available through an online system accessible on our website:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__cdph.us17.list-2Dmanage.com_track_click-3Fu-3D7796916625e499d01e3bf0965-26id-3Db3db28b6df-26e-3Dae2f1f7618&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=Lr0a7ed3egkbwePCNW4ROg&amp;r=vxRH0zPmzDa-I8zbXrG58yvK4k5bx37zuEXKoqq2MiE&amp;m=W_QNs_FdF6w72PU8XaAPyMYLVMgS4z6jM7_P-4iJq4U&amp;s=bnjjHwdS3OHlblSGyHeMHRUk7HmiokUZxNyRUaxvx7Q&amp;e=\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u%3Dhttps-3A__cdph.us17.list-2Dmanage.com_track_click-3Fu-3D7796916625e499d01e3bf0965-26id-3Db3db28b6df-26e-3Dae2f1f7618%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3DLr0a7ed3egkbwePCNW4ROg%26r%3DvxRH0zPmzDa-I8zbXrG58yvK4k5bx37zuEXKoqq2MiE%26m%3DW_QNs_FdF6w72PU8XaAPyMYLVMgS4z6jM7_P-4iJq4U%26s%3DbnjjHwdS3OHlblSGyHeMHRUk7HmiokUZxNyRUaxvx7Q%26e%3D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1523126767435000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEC9ZRYSZTC9YPWNRaQWSn_Lm5CiA\">www.cdph.ca.gov/mcsb/apply</a>.
