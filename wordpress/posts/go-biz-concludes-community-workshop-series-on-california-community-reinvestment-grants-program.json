We will be accepting any additional feedback until December 14, 2018. GO-Biz will still be available to answer questions after this date. Please send all comments and questions to <a href=\"mailto:CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov\">CalCRG@gobiz.ca.gov</a>. </p>\n<p>GO-Biz anticipates requesting additional stakeholder comments on the draft grant solicitation in early February, soliciting and evaluating grant applications during the spring of 2019, and awarding grants by June 2019.  For additional program information, including a link to the PowerPoint presented at the webinars and community workshops, please visit <a href=\"http://cts.vresp.com/c/?GOBiz/e61200bdc0/2f75a56266/ce5a085733\">www.business.ca.gov/CalCRG</a>.</p>\n",
