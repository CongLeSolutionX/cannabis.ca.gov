At this site you will also find the proposed medical regulations that were released last week for licensing dispensaries, distribution and transporters.</p>\n<p>Part of today’s announcement includes the news of four public hearings for the purpose of public comment on the proposed regulations. The bureau encourages all interested stakeholders to review the proposed regulations and come to a hearing near you to provide feedback. Hearing dates and locations are as follows:</p>\n<p>June 1, 2017</p>\n<p>1:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Adorni Center</p>\n<p>1011 Waterfront Drive, Eureka, CA 95501</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>June 8, 2017</p>\n<p>1:00 p.m. – 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Junipero Serra Building</p>\n<p>320 W. Fourth Street, Los Angeles, CA 90013</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>June 13, 2017</p>\n<p>4:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>King Library, Second Floor</p>\n<p>150 E. San Fernando Street, San Jose, CA 95112</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>June 20, 2017</p>\n<p>10:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>Department of Consumer Affairs, Hearing Room, S-102</p>\n<p>1625 North Market Boulevard, Sacramento, CA 95834</p>\n<p>Please note these dates, times and locations are different from the hearing dates for the regulations announced last week (<a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/media_20170428.pdf\">Press Release</a>).</p>\n<p>Those who wish to provide feedback and are unable to attend one of the four listed sessions above, can get involved in the regulatory process by following the steps outlined <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/17-065_public_comment.pdf\" aria-label=\"Regulatory process steps\">here</a>.­</p>\n<p>There is currently budget trailer bill language designed to align the Medical Cannabis Safety and Regulation Act with Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act. If that bill passes, the bureau will withdraw these proposed regulations and propose a new set of regulations consistent with changes in the law. However, public comments on the regulations published today are still very important.</p>\n<p>Beginning a little more than a year ago, the Bureau kicked off its outreach efforts with nine informational sessions in locations all around the state. Those sessions were followed up last Fall by eight pre-regulatory stakeholder meetings with discussions centering on issues related to general licensing requirements, and specific concepts related to the regulation of medical cannabis dispensaries, distributors and transporters. The feedback from those sessions can be reviewed <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/meetings/summaries.shtml\" aria-label=\"Feedback from stakeholder meetings\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>For additional information about BMCR, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit our website &#8211; <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/\">https://bcc.ca.gov/</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"/\">Back to Home Page</a></p>\n",
