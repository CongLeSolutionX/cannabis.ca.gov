Therefore, you must collect from your customer the same amount of cannabis excise tax that you paid to your distributor. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Discounted cannabis &#8211; arm&#8217;s length transaction </span></strong></p>\n<p><span><br />\nFor example, you purchase two items of cannabis products for $100 ($50 each) and your distributor calculates the average market price of these two items as $160 (your wholesale cost of $100 plus the current predetermined CDTFA markup of 60 percent*). The distributor collects $24 in cannabis excise tax from you on this purchase ($160 x 15 percent).</span></p>\n<p>If your regular selling price of these items is $100 each, when you offer your customers a &#8220;two for one promotion&#8221; on these items, that is, get two for the price of one, you are required to collect from your customer the $24 in cannabis excise tax paid to your distributor on these two items. Therefore, you should factor the excise tax you paid to your distributor into your discounted or promotional price.</p>\n<p>You are not required to separately state the amount of cannabis excise tax collected from your customer on the receipt, but the receipt must state, <i>&#8220;The cannabis excise taxes are included in the total amount of this invoice.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p><i>* This example assumes a mark-up rate of 60 percent (0.60). Your distributor will use the rate in effect at the time of sale. The current rate can be found on our <a href=\"http://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/tax-rates-stfd.htm\"><span>website</span></a>.</i></p>\n<p><strong><span>Discounted cannabis &#8211; nonarm&#8217;s length transaction </span></strong></p>\n<p><span><br />\nThe cannabis excise tax due in a nonarm&#8217;s length transaction is based on the retail selling price of the cannabis or cannabis products. For example, if you sell cannabis for a discounted price of $100 to your retail customer, the cannabis excise tax due is $15 ($100 x 15%), regardless of your wholesale cost.</span></p>\n<p>You are not required to separately state the amount of cannabis excise tax collected from your customer on the receipt, but the receipt must state, <i>&#8220;The cannabis excise taxes are included in the total amount of this invoice.&#8221;</i></p>\n<p><span>This email is intended to give you an overview of some of the requirements for cannabis retailers and does not address all requirements for the cannabis industry.
