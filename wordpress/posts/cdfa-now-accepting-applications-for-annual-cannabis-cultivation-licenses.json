Temporary licenses issued by CDFA will be good for 120 days, with the possibility of extensions, if warranted.</span></p>\n<p><span>The online licensing system can be accessed </span><a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/67155/107898/1120/4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span aria-label=\"CDFA Online licensing system\">here</span></a><span>. New users will be required to register for an account within the online licensing system prior to applying for a license.</span></p>\n<p><span>Temporary licenses are only issued to applicants with a valid license, permit, or other authorization from their local jurisdiction.</span></p>\n<p><span>CDFA&#8217;s emergency regulations are now in effect and the final text can be found </span><a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/67155/107898/1121/5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span aria-label=\"CDFA emergency regulations\">here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n",
