The operation resulted in the seizure of $400,000 in cannabis products and illicit vape pens. Additionally, $55,724 in cash was seized at the scene.</p>\n<p>Last week, DOI-CEU and the Los Angeles Police Department also served a search warrant on “High Society Wellness Center”, an unlicensed retailer located at 2000 Marengo St., Unit G in Los Angeles. The collaborative operation resulted in the seizure of $113,220 in cannabis products, which included approximately 190 illicit vape cartridges.</p>\n<p>The combined value of illegal cannabis products and cash seized from these unlicensed operators totaled over $560,000.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California must be conducted on a premise with a valid license issued by the appropriate state cannabis licensing authority. Manufacturing, distributing or selling cannabis goods without a state license or at a location that is not licensed is a violation of state law.
