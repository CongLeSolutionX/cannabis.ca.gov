The API allows stakeholders to obtain license data that can be integrated into their own software. Users may use the API to obtain information for a single license, a list of licenses, or the entire license directory in a single request. The data available through the API mirrors the publicly-available data in the Bureau’s license search and is updated nightly. </p>\n<p>“The API was developed to provide stakeholders with an additional tool to access the Bureau’s licensing data and to provide greater flexibility in utilizing that information,” Bureau Chief Lori Ajax said.  </p>\n<p>This API allows users to access all the publicly-available Bureau licensee data in a convenient comprehensive format. The information available through the API allows the user to confirm with certainty that they are not supporting an illegal cannabis business. Third party software application providers can utilize the API to go ‘straight to the source’ instead of relying on self-reported data from businesses or manually looking up every retailer. </p>\n<p>To get started, please consult the API User Guide here – <a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/iservices_api_user_guide.pdf\">https://bcc.ca.gov/about_us/documents/iservices_api_user_guide.pdf</a>. The guide contains step-by-step instructions about how to receive licensing data from the Bureau through the API. </p>\n<p>For questions or issues not addressed by the API User Guide, please contact the DCA iServices API Team at the following email address: <a href=\"mailto:iservices@dca.ca.gov\">iservices@dca.ca.gov</a>.  </p>\n",
