The Bureau is continuing enforcement activities against businesses not complying with cannabis advertising laws.”</p>\n<p>In June, the Bureau officially kicked off its “Get #Weedwise” campaign to encourage consumers to only shop at licensed retailers. For more information on the campaign, please visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bcc.ca.gov/consumers/weedwise.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\">https://www.bcc.ca.gov/consumers/weedwise.html</a></p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law.
