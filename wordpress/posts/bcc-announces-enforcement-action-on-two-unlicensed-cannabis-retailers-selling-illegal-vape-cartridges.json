      "rendered": "<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) and the Department of Consumer Affairs’ Cannabis Enforcement Unit (DOI-CEU) today announced enforcement action against two unlicensed cannabis retailers in Southern California selling illegal vape cartridges.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, September 11, 2019, DOI-CEU served a search warrant on “Made In Cali”, an unlicensed cannabis retailer located at 6212 Santa Monica Blvd. in Los Angeles. The search warrant resulted in the seizure of nearly $2 million in cannabis products. The Los Angeles Police Department assisted DOI-CEU in the serving of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, September 12, 2019, DOI-CEU served a separate search warrant on “Garden of Faith”, an unlicensed cannabis retailer located at 24400 Muirlands Blvd. in Lake Forest. The search warrant resulted in the seizure of over $840,000 in cannabis products. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department assisted DOI-CEU in the serving of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>These two search warrants were served as a direct result of the complaints received by the Bureau reporting sales of illegal vape cartridges. The value of cannabis seized from the two unlicensed operators totaled over $2.8 million.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law.
