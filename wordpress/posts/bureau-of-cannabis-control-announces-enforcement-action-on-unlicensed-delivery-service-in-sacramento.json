The Cannaisseur Club also charged customers for the local taxes, but failed to remit those taxes to the state.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law. Enforcement of unlicensed commercial cannabis activity may occur at the state and/or the local level.</p>\n<p>To file a complaint regarding an entity licensed by the Bureau of Cannabis Control, click here – <a href=\"https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Cap/CapApplyDisclaimer.aspx?CAPType=Enforcement/Cannabis/Complaint/General%20Complaint&amp;Module=Enforcement\">Enforcement Online Services</a>. Once the user clicks File a Complaint, they will be prompted to select a license type, or they can simply report on unlicensed activity. After filling out the nature of the complaint, the user then reviews and submits the complaint to the Bureau for follow up.</p>\n<p>The Department of Consumer Affairs’ DOI is a law enforcement agency that protects California consumers and licensees by investigating violations of California’s laws, regulations and professional standards.</p>\n<p>For additional information on reporting licensed or unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.
