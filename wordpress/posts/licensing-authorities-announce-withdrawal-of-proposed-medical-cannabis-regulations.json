The official withdrawal will occur October 6. The proposed regulations were geared toward the implementation of the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. These licensing authorities held hearings and accepted public comments regarding the proposed regulations during a 45-day public comment period.</p>\n<p>However, in late June, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed into law, the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which creates one regulatory system for both medicinal and adult-use cannabis. Because of that action, the licensing authorities will withdraw the proposed medical regulations and will instead move forward with one regulatory package for both medicinal and adult-use cannabis.</p>\n<p>The three cannabis licensing authorities will develop emergency regulations based on the new law and will incorporate the robust and valuable public comment received on the proposed medical cannabis regulations. The summary of public comments, as well as the responses to those comments, received by each agency – either in writing or in person at one of the public comment forums hosted by the three agencies – can be viewed by clicking the links below:</p>\n<p><strong>Bureau of Cannabis Control:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/mcrsa_comments.pdf\">http://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/mcrsa_comments.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/mcrsa_lab_comments.pdf\">http://bcc.ca.gov/law_regs/mcrsa_lab_comments.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>CA Department of Food and Ag:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/09/Medical-Cannabis-Cultivation-Regulations-Draft-Comment-Summary.pdf\">/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/09/Medical-Cannabis-Cultivation-Regulations-Draft-Comment-Summary.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>CA Department of Public Health:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Cannabis%20Comments%20(Final%20on%20CDPH%20Letterhead).pdf\">https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Cannabis%20Comments%20(Final%20on%20CDPH%20Letterhead).pdf</a></p>\n<p>The licensing authorities will use the emergency rulemaking process for the new regulations. The emergency regulations are expected to be published in November. The implementation date for the issuance of commercial cannabis licenses remains the same: January 1, 2018.</p>\n<p>For additional information about the three licensing authorities, or to learn about updates as they become available, please visit the state’s Cannabis Web Portal – <a href=\"\">www.cannabis.ca.gov</a>.</p>\n",
