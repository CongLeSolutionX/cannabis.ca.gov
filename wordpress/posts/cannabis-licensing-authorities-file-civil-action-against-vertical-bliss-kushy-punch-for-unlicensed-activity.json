      "rendered": "<p>SACRAMENTO – The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced today the filing of a complaint seeking civil penalties from Vertical Bliss, Inc. also known as Kushy Punch and related people for unlicensed commercial cannabis activity. The complaint was filed on September 23, 2020 by the California Office of the Attorney General in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that Vertical Bliss conducted unlicensed operations on an undisclosed premise in Canoga Park, California, and inverted illegally manufactured product back into the regulated market. On October 2, 2019, in response to tips about illegal manufacturing and distribution of cannabis goods, the Division of Investigation executed search warrants at the unlicensed Canoga Park location. The search revealed significant quantities of cannabis concentrates, edibles, vape cartridges and raw materials. Seized records document the production of more than 3.3 million Kushy Punch brand gummies during an 18-month period, with an estimated value of $64 million.</p>\n<p>Vertical Bliss simultaneously held cannabis manufacturing and distribution licenses for a premises located in Chatsworth, California. These licenses were revoked, following the discovery of the unlicensed operations.</p>\n<p>The Medicinal and Adult-Use Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) establishes strict requirements for the cannabis market and products, including requiring a state license and local approval for every premises where commercial cannabis activity is conducted. Manufacturing, distributing or selling cannabis goods without a state license or at a location that is not licensed is a violation of state law. A person engaging in commercial cannabis activity without a license is subject to civil penalties of up to three times the amount of the license fee for each day of operation.</p>\n<p>To file a complaint regarding illegal cannabis activity, click here – <a href=\"https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Cap/CapApplyDisclaimer.aspx?CAPType=Enforcement/Cannabis/Complaint/General%20Complaint&amp;Module=Enforcement\">Enforcement Online Services</a>.</p>\n",
