The City of Los Angeles confirmed this location had not applied for a local license. The LAPD assisted with the service of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>The search warrant resulted in the seizure of over $2,000,000 of cannabis and cannabis products, including almost 500 pounds of cannabis flower, over 430 gross pounds of concentrates, and over 200 gross pounds of edibles.</p>\n<p>Sevada Khanlari, the owner of the retail location, as well as six employees, were arrested on misdemeanor charges of operating a commercial cannabis business without a license to do so. Additional charges may be added once the investigation is completed by DOI-CEU and submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.&nbsp;The investigation was conducted at the request of the Bureau and was based upon a complaint the Bureau received.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities. Selling cannabis goods without a state license is a violation of state law. Enforcement of unlicensed commercial cannabis activity may occur at the state and/or the local level.</p>\n<p>To file a complaint regarding an entity licensed by the Bureau of Cannabis Control, click here – <a href=\"https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Cap/CapApplyDisclaimer.aspx?CAPType=Enforcement/Cannabis/Complaint/General%20Complaint&amp;Module=Enforcement\">Enforcement Online Services</a>. Once the user clicks File a Complaint, they will be prompted to select a license type, or they can simply report on unlicensed activity. After filling out the nature of the complaint, the user then reviews and submits the complaint to the Bureau for follow up.</p>\n<p>The Department of Consumer Affairs’ DOI is a law enforcement agency that protects California consumers and licensees by investigating violations of California’s laws, regulations and professional standards.</p>\n<p><strong><span># # #</span></strong></p>\n<p><em>For additional information about reporting licensed or unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, or to subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at <a href=\"http://www.bcc.ca.gov/\">http://www.bcc.ca.gov/</a>.
