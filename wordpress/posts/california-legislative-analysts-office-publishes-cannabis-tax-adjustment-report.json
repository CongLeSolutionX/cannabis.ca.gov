Proposition 64 also directed LAO to submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2020, with recommendations for adjustments to the state’s tax rate on cannabis to achieve three goals: undercutting illicit market prices, ensuring sufficient revenues are generated to fund the types of programs designated in the measure, and discouraging use by persons younger than 21 years of age.</p>\n<p>This report responds to that requirement. Specifically, we provide (1) background information on cannabis and its legalization in California, (2) a discussion of the effects of adjusting the tax rate, (3) an assessment of other potential changes to California’s cannabis tax structure, and (4) recommendations for the Legislature.</p>\n<p>The full report can be found on LAO&#8217;s website: <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4125/cannabis-taxes-121719.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4125/cannabis-taxes-121719.pdf</a>.</p>\n",
