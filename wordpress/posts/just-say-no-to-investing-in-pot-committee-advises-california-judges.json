In Washington state, judges cannot allow court employees to have medical marijuana businesses, and in Colorado, judges cannot use marijuana, according to the committee.</p>\n<p>The Committee on Judicial Ethics Opinions is made up mostly of judges. Though all its members are appointed by the state Supreme Court, it is considered an independent body.</p>\n<aside>\n<div id=\"ym_1606464552242100545\"></div>\n</aside>\n<p>The pot guidance was issued in response to a request from a judicial officer or a candidate for judicial office.</p>\n<p>The committee said judges have an obligation to make reasonable efforts to determine whether any of their financial or property investments involve the sale or manufacturing of marijuana.</p>\n<p>Among the investments they should scrutinize are private equity funds, corporate shares and real estate.</p>\n<p>Marijuana investments by the spouses of judges are also discouraged to avoid the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n",
