Our staff will be working weekends and may reach out for any additional documentation we need. Your prompt response will help expedite the processing of your application.</p>\n<p>We have received a high volume of applications over the last several weeks and cannot guarantee that all temporary applications received will be processed prior to the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The best way to submit your applications is through our on-line system at: <a href=\"https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Welcome.aspx\">https://aca5.accela.com/bcc/Welcome.aspx</a></p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>-Bureau of Cannabis Control</p>\n",
