It is a one-stop portal that includes local and state resources, health services, shelters and housing, preparedness information, and more.</p>\n<p>“California continues to rise to the challenge of power shutoffs and natural disasters,” said Governor Newsom. “<em>RESPONSE.CA.GOV</em> provides Californians with a unified portal for critical information during this state of emergency. This site will continuously be updated as needed to provide Californians with the resources they need.”</p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http://response.ca.gov/\">RESPONSE.CA.GOV</a></em></strong> provides Californians with information and resources for current incidents, transportation impacts, vital health services information, shelter and housing locations, unemployment assistance and other state information. The website also directs users to Public Safety Power Shutoff information and preparedness tips. As incidents continue to evolve, the portal will be updated to reflect the latest information and any additional resources the state may develop.</p>\n<p>The Governor yesterday <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/27/governor-newsom-declares-statewide-emergency-due-to-fires-extreme-weather-conditions/\">declared a statewide emergency</a> due to the dangerous weather conditions. <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/28/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-getty-fire-response/\">Earlier today</a>, Governor Newsom joined the state’s top fire and emergency management officials to provide an update on statewide fire and wind conditions, and announced that California has secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant to help ensure the availability of resources to fight the Getty Fire. California has also secured Fire Management Assistance Grants to bolster the response to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/24/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-kincade-fire-response/\">Kincade</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/24/california-secures-federal-assistance-to-support-tick-fire-response/\">Tick</a> fires, for which the Governor previously declared a state of emergency in <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/25/governor-newsom-declares-state-of-emergency-in-sonoma-and-los-angeles-counties-due-to-fires/\">Sonoma and Los Angeles</a> counties.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the past week, the Governor has met with emergency responders, health officials, residents and local leaders in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CALFIRE/videos/773042713153437/?type=2&amp;theater\">Petaluma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CALFIRE/videos/507398476658937/?type=2&amp;theater\">Napa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/25/12316/\">Geyserville</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/23/tomorrow-governor-newsom-to-host-two-events-in-los-angeles/\">Los Angeles</a>, and held public briefings regarding the ongoing fire threats and the need to hold utilities accountable for the consequences of their power shutoff decisions.</p>\n<p>The Governor has also announced a <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/25/governor-newsom-launches-75-million-program-for-state-and-local-governments-to-mitigate-impacts-of-power-shutoffs/\">$75 Million Program</a> for state and local governments to mitigate the impacts of power shutoffs, and unveiled a series of <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2019/10/26/governor-newsom-announces-new-partnerships-and-tools-to-help-californias-most-vulnerable-residents-during-power-shutoffs/\">new partnerships and new tools</a> to help secure medically vulnerable populations during these events.</p>\n<p>Under Governor Newsom’s leadership, California passed <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1054\" target=\"_BLANK翽\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AB 1054</a>, wildfire safety and utility reform legislation that expands the CPUC’s ability to hold utilities accountable for their safety record — a central part of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/CA-Fire.Energy-Plan.pdf\">Governor’s wildfire safety actions</a>.</p>\n<p>The legislation created a new <a href=\"https://www.sonomanews.com/news/10203286-181/california-names-director-for-wildfire\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wildfire safety division at the CPUC</a> and a board of independent expert advisors to more effectively regulate the safety of publicly owned utilities. The law mandated that utilities <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/energy-green/story/2019-07-12/newsom-signs-wildfire-liability-legislation-and-hires-a-new-utilities-commission-president\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tie executive compensation to safety performance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9792838-181/gov-newsom-signs-wildfire-bill\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invest $5 billion in safety improvements</a> without profit, and go through a new yearly wildfire <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-25/california-utilities-agree-to-pay-10-5-billion-into-new-wildfire-fund\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">safety review and certification</a> process. It also requires new <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wildfire-liability-fund-for-california-utilities-approved-by-lawmakers/\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">inspections of utility electrical equipment</a>. Under the law, utilities must create a <a href=\"https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2019/07/12/newsom-quickly-signs-wildfire-legislation-into-law/1717617001/\" target=\"_BLANK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wildfire safety committee</a> in their corporate board, and provide direct board-level safety reporting to the CPUC.</p>\n",
