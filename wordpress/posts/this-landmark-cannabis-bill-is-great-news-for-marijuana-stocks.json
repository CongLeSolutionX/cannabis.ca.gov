ArcView estimates that legal sales could top $22 billion by 2021, with investment firm Cowen &amp; Co. expecting legal sales to hit $50 billion by 2026. Regardless of what estimate you choose to believe, the legal marijuana industry is growing by between 20% and 30% a year. That type of consistent long-term growth is certainly appealing to investors.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Image source: Pixabay.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"tncms-region-article_instory_top\"></div>\n<div></div>\n",
