      "rendered": "<p>Beginning at 8:00 AM on Saturday, June 9, 2018, you will not be able the access the Bureau’s online licensing system while it undergoes maintenance necessary to implement the new emergency regulations. The Bureau anticipates the maintenance to be completed by midday on Saturday and you will then be able to access the system. The most significant change during this maintenance is that applicants will be able to submit one license application to conduct medicinal and adult-use cannabis activity of the same type at the licensed premises. If the application is approved, the Bureau will issue one license with a designation of A, M, or A and M.</p>\n<p>1) For applicants that have not yet submitted an annual or temporary application: The Bureau advises potential applicants wait to submit any temporary or annual applications until the system has been updated to reflect the changes.</p>\n<p>2) For licensees that hold both adult-use and medicinal temporary licenses for the same commercial cannabis activity: If you currently hold an adult-use temporary license and a medicinal temporary license that allows you to conduct the same commercial cannabis activity at one location, your records are being consolidated and you now hold one license with both and an adult-use-designation and a medicinal-designation. Once you login to the system, you will have the ability to download your new license certificate. To do this, click your temporary license number on the “my records” button and go to the attachments page to retrieve your new license certificate.</p>\n<p>3) For licensees and applicants that have submitted applications for both adult-use and medicinal annual licenses for the same commercial cannabis activity: If you have submitted an application for an adult-use annual license and a medicinal annual license to conduct the same commercial cannabis activity at one location, your records are being consolidated and you will have one license application for both an adult-use-designation and a medicinal-designation on your license. If the application is approved, you will be assessed one license fee.</p>\n<p>When you see “merged” in the status column, this license record has been merged into your other license record and will no longer be used. If the status column does not say “merged”, this is the license record number that you will use exclusively going forward.</p>\n<p>For any questions relating to the Bureau’s online licensing system, please contact our Call Center at 833-768-5880 or send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:bcc@dca.ca.gov\">bcc@dca.ca.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Bureau staff</p>\n",
