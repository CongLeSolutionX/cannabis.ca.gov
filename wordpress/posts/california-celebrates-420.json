Among various theories is the belief is that a group of California teenagers in San Rafael created the term in 1971. The friends, who called themselves <a href=\"https://420waldos.com/\">the Waldos</a>, would met at 4:20 p.m. to search for an abandoned marijuana crop and get high, apparently.</p>\n<aside></aside>\n<p>Others say the term came from police codes for smoking pot in public. But that penal code in California actually refers to obstructing entry into public land.</p>\n<p>California in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana for medicinal use. Then in November, Californians overwhelmingly supported <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-proposition-64-marijuana-legalization-qa-20161030-snap-20161029-story.html\">Proposition 64</a>, a measure that allowed residents who are 21 and older to possess, transport, buy and use up to an ounce of cannabis for recreational purposes and allow individuals to grow as many as six plants.</p>\n<p>The measure allows non-medical marijuana to be sold only by state licensed businesses, and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html\">gives the state until Jan. 1, 2018</a>, to begin issuing sales licenses for recreational retailers.</p>\n<p>Although several states, including California, Colorado and Oregon, have legalized marijuana for recreational use, cannabis is still considered a Schedule 1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration and is not “currently accepted medical use.” <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-marijuana-420-day-california-20170420-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(Read Full Story)</a></p>\n",
