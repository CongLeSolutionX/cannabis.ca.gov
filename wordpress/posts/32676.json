The focus of the updates to the Cannabis Policy involve:  (a) allowing some existing onstream reservoirs to obtain water rights for cannabis cultivation; (b) updating the Water Boards tribal notification process for cannabis cultivation sites that are on or within 600 feet of Tribal lands; (c) updates to tribal buffers conditionally exempt for indoor cultivation sites; and (d) updates to the winterization requirements to allow for cultivation on flat lands.</p>\n"
