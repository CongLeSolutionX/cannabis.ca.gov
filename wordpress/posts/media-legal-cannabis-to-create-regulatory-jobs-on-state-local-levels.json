They will begin licensing businesses in January.</p>\n<p>The Bureau of Cannabis Control is taking the lead, and between now and the end of the year, it plans to hire another 80 employees. A spokesperson says part of their work will include incapacitating the black market for marijuana.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In order to do that we need people who are going to help regulate the industry, who are going to go to those folks who aren&#8217;t coming into regulation and are resistant, and who are maybe still operating under the old way of doing things where there were no rules and regulations to follow,&#8221; said Bureau of Cannabis Control Spokesman Alex Traverso. &#8220;And (they&#8217;ll) try to get them into compliance or out of business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From staff services manager to environmental scientist, the bureau has jobs posted on the state&#8217;s website right now, under the Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>\n<p>CalCannabis, part of the Department of Food and Agriculture, is also advertising jobs on their social media pages. They&#8217;ll be in charge of issuing licenses to marijuana cultivation facilities, which some Valley cities are considering to allow&#8211; local governments will need to hire as well.</p>\n<p>Hanford City Manager Darrel Pyle says they&#8217;ll need more employees to process permits, inspect buildings, as well as two more police officers to help with compliance.</p>\n<p>Coalinga officials say they&#8217;ve added a police officer and two clerks since allowing cannabis cultivation. They may add more city jobs to keep up with demand.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, state officials say as their regulations roll out, the roles of their employees may overlap with those who work at the local level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Local governments are our partners,&#8221; Traverso said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to need to sort of work together as we kind of get through some initial growing pains.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Traverso says the bureau jobs will be based in Sacramento, but there may eventually be district offices in different parts of the state.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://jobs.ca.gov/CalHRPublic/Search/AdvancedJobSearch.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">To find out what jobs are available search here.</a></strong></p>\n</div>\n",
