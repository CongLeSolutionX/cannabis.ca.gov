As a result, CDFA can no longer issue temporary licenses and any pending application for a temporary license will not be approved. The temporary cultivation applications that remain were not approved because either the application was submitted after December 1, 2018, leaving insufficient processing time, or the application was deemed deficient because required information was not received in time to be processed.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR EXTENSIONS OF TEMPORARY LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2019</strong></p>\n<p>Extensions of temporary licenses were granted to anyone who submitted and paid for an annual application by midnight December 31, 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>IS IT STILL POSSIBLE TO APPLY FOR A CANNABIS CULTIVATION LICENSE?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. CDFA is accepting annual commercial cannabis cultivation license applications and online <a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/87305/107898/1533/3/\">a</a><a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/87305/107898/1534/4/\">nnual a</a><a href=\"http://lists.cdfa.ca.gov/t/87305/107898/1535/5/\">pplications are available</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>FOR MORE INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>If you have questions about temporary, provisional, or annual commercial cannabis cultivation licenses, call us toll-free at 1-833-CALGROW (1-833-225-4769) or send us an email at <a href=\"mailto:calcannabis@cdfa.ca.gov\">calcannabis@cdfa.ca.gov</a>.
