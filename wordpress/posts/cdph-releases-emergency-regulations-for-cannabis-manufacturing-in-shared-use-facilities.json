The proposed emergency regulations will be filed with the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) on April 3, 2018, and undergo a five-day public comment period, from April 3 until April 8, 2018.</p>\n<p>The regulations, released by CDPH’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, were developed to provide opportunities for small manufacturing businesses and in response to demand from cities and counties wishing to implement equity programs.</p>\n<p>The regulatory text, finding of emergency, a fact sheet and instructions for submitting public comment can be viewed on the CDPH website, <a href=\"https://cdph.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7796916625e499d01e3bf0965&amp;id=7bd2c63c63&amp;e=4c7be124c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.cdph.ca.gov/mcsb/regulations</a>, or at the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cdph.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7796916625e499d01e3bf0965&amp;id=14f948a9bc&amp;e=4c7be124c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Proposed Emergency Regulations for Shared-Use Facilities</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cdph.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7796916625e499d01e3bf0965&amp;id=80752a05ac&amp;e=4c7be124c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finding of Emergency</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cdph.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7796916625e499d01e3bf0965&amp;id=4e7d9295bf&amp;e=4c7be124c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Emergency Regulations Fact Sheet</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under the proposed rules, a cannabis manufacturer with a Type 7, 6 or N license would register their location as a shared-use facility. After approval of their registration, cannabis manufacturers wishing to utilize that space would apply for a Type S license. The license structure would allow for operations similar to a commercial kitchen or agreements in which larger manufacturers offer space and use of equipment to smaller ones. The licensed premises will only be permitted for cannabis-specific manufacturing activities.</p>\n<p>The emergency regulations for shared-use facilities are expected to be approved on April 13, 2018. Once approved, CDPH will begin accepting temporary shared-use facility registrations and Type S temporary license applications. The application will be available on the CDPH website, <a href=\"https://cdph.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=7796916625e499d01e3bf0965&amp;id=fea34fc2e1&amp;e=4c7be124c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.cdph.ca.gov/mcsb/apply</a>.</p>\n<h6><strong>About the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch</strong></h6>\n<p>The California Department of Public Health’s Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch (MCSB) is one of three state cannabis authorities charged with licensing and regulating commercial cannabis activity in California.
