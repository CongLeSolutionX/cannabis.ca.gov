These proposed regulations would make it mandatory for cannabis businesses to post their unique Quick Response Code (QR Code) certificate in storefront windows and carry it with them while transporting or delivering cannabis.</p>\n<p>The emergency regulations are designed to help consumers identify licensed cannabis retail stores, assist law enforcement and support the legal cannabis market, where products such as vape cartridges are routinely tested to protect public health and safety.</p>\n<p>Those who wish to comment on the proposed emergency regulations must submit their comment directly to OAL within five calendar days of OAL’s posting of the proposed regulations on their website. The comment period will begin on Monday, February 3, 2020, and end on Saturday, February 8, 2020. You may submit comments on the proposed regulations to OAL at:</p>\n<p><strong>Office of Administrative Law</strong><br />OAL Reference Attorney <br />300 Capitol Mall, Suite 1250 <br />Sacramento, CA 95814 <br />E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:staff@oal.ca.gov\">staff@oal.ca.gov</a></p>\n<p>When you submit a comment to OAL, you must also submit a copy of your comment simultaneously to the Bureau at:</p>\n<p><strong>Bureau of Cannabis Control</strong><br />2920 Kilgore Road<br />Rancho Cordova, CA 95670<br />E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:BCC.comments@dca.ca.gov\">BCC.comments@dca.ca.gov</a></p>\n<p>OAL will confirm the Bureau has received the comment before considering it. Pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 1, section 55(b)(1) through (4), the comment must state that it is about an emergency regulation currently under OAL review and include the topic of the emergency.</p>\n<p>Adoption of emergency regulations does not require response to comments. Any responses to comments from the Bureau will be submitted to OAL within eight calendar days following the date of submission of the proposed emergency regulation to OAL unless specific exceptions are applicable.</p>\n<p><em>To subscribe to email alerts to hear about updates as they become available, please visit the Bureau’s website at </em><a href=\"https://bcc.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>https://bcc.ca.gov/</em></a><em>.
