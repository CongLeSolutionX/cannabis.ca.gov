Ramsey St. in the city of Banning. The search warrant resulted in the seizure of over $1.6 million in cannabis products. Two misdemeanor citations were also issued.</p>\n<p>The Banning Police Department assisted DOI-CEU in the serving of the search warrant.</p>\n<p>All commercial cannabis activity in California requires a state-issued license from one of the state’s three cannabis licensing authorities.
