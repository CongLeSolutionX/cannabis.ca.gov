# cannabis.ca.gov

## Project description
Production instance of [cannabis.ca.gov](https://cannabis.ca.gov) for the Department of Cannabis Control. 
* Built to deliver plain-language, performant, accessible information.

## How our static publishing system works
### 1. Edit
* Content is created and edited by DCC staff in WordPress at api.cannabis.ca.gov.
* All media are uploaded to a static bucket.

### 2. Sync 
* After posts are edited, a notification is fired off, and an AWS Lambda [syncing service](https://github.com/cagov/cannabis-ca-gov-lambda-sync-github) pulls data from WordPress through the WordPress REST API.
* The data is processed and loaded into a [static content package](https://github.com/cagov/static-content-cannabis). 
* When this repo is installed, `npm` will get the site content and make it usable in the 11ty build.

### 3. Update static site
This repo uses [11ty](https://11ty.dev) as a static site builder.
* The `./src/.eleventy.js` script generates a static build of the site.

### 4. Publish
We use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflows to manage publishing and site builds.
* Our `.yml` scripts manage how the site is published.
* The general process is to build the site, update the site's AWS S3 bucket, then clear the AWS CloudFront cache.
* Workflow files are found at: [`main`](./.github/workflows/eleventy_build_main.yml), [~`staging`~](./.github/workflows/eleventy_build_staging.yml) 
* When submitting a pull request (PR), a separate instance of the site is available through a link in the PR. [PR Previews](./.github/workflows/eleventy_build_pr.yml)

## Developer notes

### Installation
* Make sure `npm` and `node` are installed locally. Current version: Node 16.x, npm 8.5.0.
* `npm install` - install the packages in `package.json` and development dependencies.
* `npm run dev` for local builds.
* `npm build` to generate static repo at `./docs`. You can also run `http-server` or `serve` to view this site in a local web server.
* `npm run content:clean` and `npm run content:update` will get the latest content changes and reset content.
* You can work locally with the markup generated from https://api.cannabis.ca.gov editor. 
* [NOT YET RE-RELEASED]: `npm test` - run playwright tests.
* [NOT INCLUDED]: Linting
* Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md) for additional information.

### Tips
* All Eleventy configuration settings are located at `./config`. We use multiple branches and production, stating, and other branches, and this configuration file is the source of truth for all settings.
* The content is copied from `node_modules/static-content-cannabis` into `./pages/_content` and used at runtime. 
* The `./pages/_content.11tydata.js` file is where any domains from the edit are replaces and made relative to the static/headless instance.
* CA Design System components are located at `./src/components`, and managed via `package.json`. Any custom components are also located in this folder.
* Design tokens can be found in `./src/css`. 

### Cannabis local ordinances map
* See [README](./src/components/charts/cannabis-local-ordinances/README.md)

### Project management and updates
* Submit a pull request to the latest release branch: `release/2.x.x` etc.
* We use a task board in Coda to manage our support issues and past development. 
* For future development, use the desired project management tool.
* If a public issue trail is desired, we recommend creating tickets for concrete code tasks that pertain to the code, and linking the issue in any all team internal tracking tools.

### Troubleshooting
* Check the status of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cagov/cannabis.ca.gov/actions) to see if the site built.
* Check status of [AWS](https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status), [Github](https://www.githubstatus.com/)
* Please refer to https://github.com/cagov/static-content-cannabis for more detailed technical notes on how the publishing system is built.

## Design system components
