Board: @DOCS

# 1.0.0-rc
From [Office of Digital Innovation](https://digital.ca.gov), October 1, 2021

* Data comes from former WordPress monolith site (üèî).
* Github issues: https://github.com/cagov/cannabis.ca.gov
* Add cypress tests

# 0.0.1
From [Office of Digital Innovation](https://digital.ca.gov) & [CAWeb publishing](https://caweb.cdt.ca.gov/), July 2021 @DOCS
* Launch initial cannabis.ca.gov (üçÉ) for the [Department of Cannabis Control](https://cannabis.ca.gov) website on [CAWeb](https://caweb.cdt.ca.gov/) publishing [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) instance.
* @DOCS Can we include a reference link here about the project.
* Write a WordPress [plugin](https://github.com/ca-design-system-gutenberg-blocks) to act as a bridge between current monolith sites and a decoupled architecture. (<@DOCS>) 
* ODI uses the built-in WordPress REST API to develop fast loading, light, performant, accessible site. This site is similar in structure to how ODI built the [covid19](https://covid19.ca.gov) (created by the team who developed and maintained this site from March 2020 until the present). 
* This leveraged the work of the Alpha team @DOCS:@abquirarte-(do you have a link?)
